#SCENARIO 6: The Border (891 SI, March)
#
#This scenario returns to the story of Caius. You have broken the seige of Portum Frigae, but you are not
#home free. Although the fire slowed them down, the Marauders are chasing you. You only have a day
#and a half lead on them. You are trying to get to Sidhe lands, where you will ask them to protect
#you from the Marauders, who are their ancient enemies. It is a bit of a gamble, since the Sidhe
#dislike all men, Marauder or Lavinian.
#
#You begin the scenario almost in Sidhe lands. You have reached the border between where the
#Lavinians cleared away the forest and where the boundary with the Sidhe is. There are two rundown
#Lavinian plantations here; it is night, so you make camp in one of them. The lord of the plantation
#tells you about bandits living in the forest, who are just barely not across the Sidhe border. You
#agree to help kill them, since you will have to pass though the forest to reach the Sidhe. On the
#sixth turn of the battle, Marauders appear and begin attacking your rear flank. If any of your
#units or any of the bandits or any of the Marauders step across the Sidhe border, the Sidhe emerge
#from their forests and begin attacking. (If you do not step across, it happens scriptedly on turn
#10 or so). The Sidhe do, however, target the Marauders more than you. Your objective is to bring
#Caius next to the Sidhe leader to win.
