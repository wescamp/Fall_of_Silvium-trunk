#SCENARIO 4: The Port City (891 SI, February)
#
#Once you get there, you try to convince the Tribune of Portum Frigae that you have to flee,
#either to the lands of the Sidhe or by ship to Dardania. Unfortunately, the Tribune not agree with
#you - he wants to turn you over to the Marauders, since, he reasons, it is only you that they want.
#You must attack him and take over the city.
#
#However, before you defeat him, Marauder raiders appear from the forest. You are forced to fight
#both this Tribune and the Marauders; since you cannot defeat the Marauders thus divided, your only
#hope is to either evacuate the city by boat, or make a mad dash for the Sidhe border. The
#Marauders, you think, will not dare follow you into Sidhe lands.
#
#Once you kill this other Tribune, the remnants of his army join you; their only other choice is to
#continue fighting both you and the Marauders, which is suicide. At that point, the Marauders get
#reinforcements; you still cannot defeat them. You have to put the civilians into ships, and
#evacuate them. You yourself have to leave the city by foot, so that the Marauders will chase you
#instead of getting in their longboats and destroying the helpless transport ships. Of course,
#defeating the marauder leader will have the same effect as winning the scenario the other way.
#
#As you leave the city, you burn it to slow down the Marauders.
