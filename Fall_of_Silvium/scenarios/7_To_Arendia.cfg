#SCENARIO 7: To Arendia (891 SI, May)
#
#The marauders are more foolish than you thought. They dare not invade Sidhe lands, but they are
#fine with entering Arendia. They reach the mountain pass that you must take just as the Sidhe have
#brought you there. The sidhe ally with you, but after the lord who wants to help you is killed by
#Marauders, the opposing Lord takes over, and you have to fight both sidhe and marauders. You cannot
#defeat them; you have to bring Caius south through the mountain pass to the safety of Arendia.
#
#HOW THE PLOT TWIST WORKS
#Leithan hints that he wants a better way of resolving the issue than trying to defeat the Marauders
#in battle, but you don't know exactly what he meant. It becomes clear only after he begins heading
#towards the Marauder camp. He immediately challenges the Marauder Lord to a duel; the Lord accepts,
#and defeats him (in a sort of tricky manner). Vaniyera blames YOU!
#
#HOW IT USED TO WORK,
#WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME BUT WHICH IS ACTUALLY RATHER IRRITATING:
#The scenario plays out relatively normally. At some point in the scenario, a Marauder ambush
#appears next to the Sidhe leader. This should happen at the beginning of the Marauder turn - that
#way, you can't interfere, and save the Sidhe leader when that was not supposed to be able to
#happen. We need to create fake Marauder units that will hit every time and will not be killed by
#the Sidhe leader's retaliation. Then, replace them with normal Marauder units, and let them be
#killed by the remaining Sidhe units, one of which, the other Lord, becomes a leader unit.
